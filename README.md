Certainly! Here's a simple description you can use for Git:

"I created a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operation using PHP with the RedBeanPHP ORM. This allows users to perform basic database operations (such as adding, viewing, updating, and deleting records) within a PHP application. RedBeanPHP simplifies database interaction by providing an object-oriented interface to interact with the database, making it easier to manage database operations without writing complex SQL queries."
